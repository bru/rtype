h2. Welcome to rType

Rtype is a Ruby on Rails application that acts as a smart front end for Movable Type blogs.
It sits on top of MT database, maps it to ActiveRecord and uses implements Rails conventions to bless MT with a proper MVC stack and improved performance.

_Please note that this is alpha software, don't use it in production. Yet_

h3. History 

This was created in order to solve some user experience issues I had with Movable Type (specifically search, comments and non-admin user authentication), but then evolved in a way to experiment with ActiveRecord mapping, dynamic routing and alternate template systems for Rails. This code has never been used in production, but I think there are some potentially useful bits here and there.

h3. Features

* Automatic routing
* UltraSphinx powered search
* Fast, low "cost" comments
* Lightweight session management (using a modified restful authentication)
* ERB templates
* ActiveRecord mapping

h3. Usage

Keep on using MT's interface for the all backend activities (writing posts, moderating comments, even editing templates). Let rtype do the rest.
To configure rType, edit config/database.yml to point to the MT database you want to render.

rType will use ERB for templates that are configured to be built "dynamically", and will try to compile MTML for the other templates.
MTML support is *just a proof of concept* at the moment, with just the basic attribute accessors working, but feel free to add more functionalities and send me a pull request, I will be happy to add that to the main repo.

ERB templates will have access to some global objects, depending on the archive type being rendered: @blog (for all templates), @category (for category templates), @entry (for individual archive templates), and so on. These are defined in the ArchivesController.
